# Todo Back

This project works in pair with [todo-frontend](https://github.com/smanicome/todo-frontend)

It is the backend of the todo project, exposing a REST API used to manipulate todo related data. As such it allows us CRUD operations

It was made using Java 21 and SpringBoot 3, with an hexagonal architecture to promote loosely-coupled components
